I finally updated my github pages website from.. 10 years ago? I'll be using this site more to write about stuff I'm working on (like [SkyDroplet](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/skydroplet-weather-forecast/id6479719868)) or stuff I'm learning about. If you're just interested in my experience, you can check out the `About` page in the header or just [click here](/about)
